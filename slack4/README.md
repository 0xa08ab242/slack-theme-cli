# Workaround for Slack-4.0.0
Install slack-theme as normal
Try using it and get file not found error
copy the files in this folder to wherever slack-them installed...

- kill slack
- run the before script - requires sudo :(
- run the slack4-theme using the new file names and file paths, pick your theme
- run the after script - requires sudo :(
- start slack

those steps worked for me, but I only tried it on macOS Mojave
